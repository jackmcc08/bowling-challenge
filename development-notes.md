This project is a continuation of week 5 bowling scorecard weekend challenge which I wrote in Ruby. For this challenge I am going to translate the model to javascript, utilising the jasmine testing framework and eslint.

After translation, I am going to attempt to build an interface with jQuery as well.

Please refer to previous weeks development notes and readme for the explanation of development of the model.

Miro Board: - Miro Board with logic

As I translate, I will also seek to refactor the model to extract the class further.
